# Undefined Shell Works!

```plain
「I am the shell of my system.」
「Command is my body, and argument is my blood.」
「I have created over a thousand lines of logs.」
「Unaware of less, nor aware of more.」
「Withstood error to create many scripts, waiting for prompt's arrival.」
「I have no mouse. This is the only bug.」
「My whole life was `Undefined Shell Works`!」
```

# Unlimited Code Works

From [CS Slayer/Unlimited Code Works](https://www.csslayer.info/wordpress/unlimited-code-works/)

```plain
「I am the bone of my program.」
「Object is my body, and class is my blood.」
「I have created over a thousand lines code.」
「Unknown to delete, nor known to new.」
「Have withstood pain to create many projects.」
「Yet, those hands will never hold anything.」
「So as I pray, Unlimited Code Works!」
```
